Project: HTML/CSS, part of The Odin Project's Web Development 101 curriculum.

The goal of this project is to deconstruct Google.com and rebuild it.

There was a lot of trial and error in the process of putting this together.  I learned mostly that centering elements is not so easy or obvious: it often takes a combination of techniques (such as using a flex or grid to align all the major elements, and then setting the items within them as blocks or inline elements to work more effectively with text or lists) to acheive the layout you are aiming for. 

The relationships between parent, child, and descendant elements can get confusing if unnecessary semantic elements are used.  That is something I'll be focusing on more closely in future projects.
